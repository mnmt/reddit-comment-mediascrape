# reddit-comment-mediascrape
This is an in-progress attempt to learn how to use the reddit api via PRAW, and also to learn how to use python at a higher level, html, jinja2, git and github.   
This code finds a range of text submissions (in this case from the /r/anime wiki) and for each one scans all comments for links, then generates an html of a list of those links for each submission.  
(I guess I can also learn some markdown too :) )
